### Explanation:

1. **Generating Valid Combinations**:
   - Use `itertools.product` to generate all possible combinations of digit counts from 0 to 3 for 10 digits.
   - Filter these combinations to find those where the sum of counts is exactly 18.

2. **Calculating Permutations**:
   - For each valid combination, calculate the permutations using the factorial function.
   - Adjust for repetitions of digits by dividing by the factorial of the counts.

3. **Handling Leading Zero**:
   - Subtract permutations where the first digit is zero by decrementing the count of zeros and recalculating the permutations.

This approach ensures we correctly count all 18-digit numbers meeting the criteria, accounting for combinatorial constraints and avoiding leading zeros.
