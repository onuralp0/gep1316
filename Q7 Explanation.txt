Explanation of the Code
Check if a number is bouncy:

The is_bouncy function converts the number to a string and checks if the digits increase and decrease. If both increasing and decreasing conditions are met at any point, the number is bouncy.
Find the least number with a specified proportion of bouncy numbers:

The find_least_bouncy_proportion function starts from 100 (since numbers below 100 cannot be bouncy) and iterates through each number, counting how many are bouncy.
For each number, it calculates the proportion of bouncy numbers encountered so far.
When the proportion reaches 99% (0.99), it returns the current number.
By running this code, you'll find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers reaches exactly 99%.
